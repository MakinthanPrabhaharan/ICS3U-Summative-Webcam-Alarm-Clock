# ICS3U-Summative-Webcam-Alarm-Clock
My summative project for ICS3U (Computer Programming) was a Java alarm clock application that would "force" the user to wake up out of bed and turn off the alarm. When the alarm rings, the webcam feed from the computer opens, and an image is displayed on the screen. To shut off the alarm, the user would have to go find the corresponding printout of the image and show it to the camera where the program would then use template matching to detect if the user has obtained the correct image, and shut the alarm off. This project used the OpenCV library to help with the computer vision task.
